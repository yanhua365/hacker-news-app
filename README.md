## reapp Hacker News App

This is a demo app built on reapp, for reading HackerNews. We've spent time
optimizing it and working around a variety of bugs in hybrid apps which
we'll be documenting in short order.

## How to run this app

```
# Install reapp globally
npm install -g reapp

# Get the code
git clone git@github.com:reapp/hacker-news-app.git
cd hacker-news-app

# Download NPM modules
